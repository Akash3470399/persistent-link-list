How to use it.

Maintain a link list of link list of integer in file
(double link list)

there are 2 link type of link list
	1. main link list 
		holds the head of data link list

	2. data link list 
		link list in which actual data is present



	[ m1 ] -> [ d1 ] -> [ d2 ] ....
	  |
	  v						here mi's are the main link list nodes
	[ m2 ] -> [ d8 ] -> [ d8 ] ....			and di's are data link list nodes
	  |
	  v
	[ m3 ] -> .....
	  .
	  .
	  .
	[ mk ]



Approch:
	A file with fixed length is treated as disk. First calculated how many main link list blocs can be calculated depending upon filesize & node size.
	Then there are 2 bitmaps which keep the record of which blocks are free & which are occupied.
										
											
				
					    X											    Y	
		 ___________________________v_______________________________________________________________________________________v___________
		|   x	|  data node bitmap	| data link list nodes......		....main link list nodes|   main node bitmap	|   y	|
		|_______|_______________________|_______________________________________________________________|_______________________|_______|

					Disk (file here) sotring the link list of link list.


	file is divide into multiple parts as shown in above diagram.
	
	When new data block is to be added we will check the availability, and then will add new block to that space & will mark that block is taken by data link list node.
	Also we will reduce one bloc from the main node bitmap as data link list node has used the spece & that space is not available to store main link list node.
	Same process will be followed while adding new main list node, & one block form data node bitmap will be reduced.

	As we will use some of space for bitmaps, so that much space will not be avalible for the nodes. So in bitmaps we will mark that much block has been preoccupied.
	
	x : Gives the last node avalable for data node bitmap
	y : Gives the last node avalable for main node bitmap
